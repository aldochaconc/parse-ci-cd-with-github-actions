# parse-ci-cd-with-github-actions
Github workflow files with production and development environment.

-  This workflow uses the back4app cli (b4a), but the process is the same if you use parse-cli
- Set your environment variables in:
    Settings > Security > Secrets > Actions > New Repository Secret.
- Instead of using two environments, I'm using two workflows ym


Hope it helps.
